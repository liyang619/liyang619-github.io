I am supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GqryWPsAAAAJ&amp;hl" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Wei Pan</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NyoHewcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Angelo Cangelosi</a>. Before starting PhD journey, I obtained the Master degree in Information and Communication Engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jun Wang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dC5WplwAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yang Yang</a>, and the Bachelor degree in Digital Media Technology from Dalian University of Technology.</p> <p>My recent research focuses on multi-agent learning in open-ended worlds, aiming to improve the adaptability of multi-agent systems to varying tasks, emergent on-the-fly co-players, and other evolving environments. The ultimate aim of my research is to advance multi-agent interaction in real-world applications where unpredictability is the norm.</p> </body></html>
